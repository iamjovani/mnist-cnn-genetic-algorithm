# mnist-cnn-genetic-algorithm
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for the MNIST dataset, optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how GAs can be used to improve neural network performance by optimizing hyperparameters
